# RESTful-API
RESTful API using Python, Flask, MongoDB and Docker

#This API was created to handle calls from another software. The objetive of this API was to create a rich Back end for a Front end HR software.<br>

#The Front end software failed so this API only can handle authentication calls. <br>

#The use of Docker helps to implement this API in any SO, reducing the risk of conflict between languages, libraries or frameworks<br>
